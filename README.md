# React Router Navigation Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Router applications: missing or incomplete navigation logic within components.  The `Home` component renders correctly but lacks a mechanism to navigate to the `/about` route.

## Bug Description

The `Home` component displays content but doesn't provide a way for the user to reach the `About` page using React Router's navigation functionality. This results in a broken user flow, as the user cannot proceed to the intended destination.

## Solution

The solution involves adding proper navigation using `useNavigate` or `<Link>` from `react-router-dom` to create interactive navigation within the `Home` component.
